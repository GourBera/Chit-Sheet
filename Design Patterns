# ****************************** Creational Design Patterns ******************************
# ============================== Singleton Design Patterns  ==============================

"""
The Singleton pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance while
providing a global access point to this instance. It is often useful when exactly one object is needed to
coordinate actions across the system.
"""

"""
it can lead to tight coupling, hard-to-test code, and make the code less flexible

Use cases:

1. When a single instance of a class must control the action throughout an application. 
For example, a logging class that writes to a single log file.
2. When a single instance of a class must provide a unique service throughout an application. 
For example, a configuration manager that holds the application's settings.
3. When a single instance of a class must coordinate actions across the system. 
For example, a single instance of a class that manages the connections to a database.
4. When a single instance of a class is responsible for managing a shared resource. 
For example, a thread pool that manages a fixed number of threads.
5. When a single instance of a class is responsible for maintaining a shared state. 
For example, a shopping cart class that maintains the items added by the user during an e-commerce application.
6. When a single instance of a class is responsible for managing a shared cache. 
For example, a class that maintains a cache of frequently used data in the memory to improve performance.

"""


class Singleton:
    _instance = None

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance


s1 = Singleton()
s2 = Singleton()
print(s1 is s2)  # True


"""
In this example, the __new__ method is overridden to return the same instance of the class, 
if it has already been created. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of the class and 
assigns it to the _instance class variable.
"""

# Another way to implement the Singleton pattern in Python is to use a decorator:


def singleton(cls):
    _instances = {}

    def get_instance():
        if cls not in _instances:
            _instances[cls] = cls()
        return _instances[cls]

    return get_instance


@singleton
class MySingleton:
    pass


s1 = MySingleton()
s2 = MySingleton()
print(s1 is s2)  # True

"""
In this example, the singleton decorator takes a class as an argument, and 
1returns a function that creates an instance of the class if it does not exist, otherwise it returns the existing instance.

It's worth noting that the Singleton pattern can be an anti-pattern, and it should be used with caution, 
as it can make the code more difficult to test and maintain, by hiding dependencies and making the system hard to understand. 
A better approach would be to use dependency injection to provide a single instance of a class 
to the parts of the system that need it.
"""


# ============================== Factory Design Patterns ==============================
"""
The Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a super class, 
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It's used to create objects without 
specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

Use cases:
1. When a class can't anticipate the type of objects it needs to create. 
For example, a class that reads data from a file and creates objects based on the data it reads.
2. When a class wants to delegate responsibility for creating objects to its subclasses. 
For example, a class that creates different types of vehicles, such as cars, trucks, and buses.
3. When a class needs to create objects that belong to a class hierarchy. 
For example, a class that creates different types of shapes, such as circles, rectangles, and triangles.
4. When a class needs to create objects that are specified at runtime. 
For example, a class that creates objects based on user input or configuration files.
5. When a class needs to create objects that are expensive or time-consuming to create. 
For example, a class that creates connections to a database or a network.
6. When a class needs to create objects that have a limited lifespan. 
For example, a class that creates objects that are used for a short period of time and then discarded.

The Factory pattern is a powerful technique to create objects in a clean and maintainable way. 
It allows you to encapsulate the object creation logic, making the code more flexible and reusable. 
It also makes it easy to add new types of objects in the future, without affecting the existing code.

"""
In this example, the get_pet function acts as a factory, it takes an argument pet which is used to 
determine which type of object to create and return. Here, it returns an instance of the Dog class or the Cat class.

class PetFactory:
    def __init__(self):
        self._pets = {}

"""
In this example, the PetFactory class acts as a factory, it has methods to register different types of 
pets and create them. The create_pet method takes a pet_type argument and creates an instance of the 
corresponding class, registered for that type.

The Factory pattern is useful when you want to decouple the process of creating objects from the 
parts of the system that use them. It can also be used to create objects that are selected at runtime, 
based on configuration or input data.
"""


# ****************************** Behavioral Design Pattern ******************************
# ============================== Observer Design Patterns  ==============================
"""
The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows objects to be notified of changes in other objects. 
It's used to establish a one-to-many relationship between objects, where one object (the subject) is being observed 
by multiple other objects (the observers).

Use Cases:

1. When an application needs to be notified of changes to one or more objects. 
For example, a stock market application that needs to be updated with the latest stock prices.
2. When an application needs to perform an action when an event occurs. 
For example, a chat application that sends a message to all connected clients when a new message is received.
3. When an application needs to track the state of multiple objects. 
For example, a weather forecasting application that tracks the temperature, humidity, and pressure in multiple locations.
4. When an application needs to maintain consistency between multiple related objects. 
For example, a spreadsheet application that updates the totals and averages when a value in a cell is changed.
5. When an application needs to implement a publish/subscribe architecture. 
For example, a social media application that notifies followers when a user posts a new message.
6. When an application needs to implement a logging or auditing system. 
For example, a system that logs all changes made to a database.

The Observer pattern is a powerful technique to keep objects in sync and improve the overall cohesion of the system. 
It enables loose coupling between objects and makes it easy to add new observers or change the behavior of existing ones. 
However, it's important to be careful when using the pattern, as it can lead to high coupling and 
performance issues if not implemented correctly.

"""
In this example, the Subject class maintains a list of observers, and provides methods to attach and detach observers. 
The notify method is used to send a notification to all the attached observers. The Observer class is an abstract class that 
defines the update method, which will be overridden by the concrete observer.
"""

"""
In this example, the Observable class implements the Iterable interface and it has methods to 
register, unregister and notify observers. The Observer class is an abstract base class that defines the update method that 
is called by the notify method of the Observable class.

The Observer pattern is useful when you have multiple objects that need to be notified of changes 
in other objects and you want to decouple the objects from one another. It's commonly used in GUI programming, 
where a change in one widget needs to be propagated to other widgets, or in event-driven systems, 
where objects need to be notified of events.
"""


# ============================== Iterator Design Patterns ==============================
"""
The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to traverse a collection of 
objects without exposing the internal implementation of the collection. This pattern provides a way to 
access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

    def iterator(self):
        return Iterator(self._items)


collection = Collection()
collection.add_item("item1")
collection.add_item("item2")
collection.add_item("item3")

for item in collection.iterator():
    print(item)

"""
In this example, the Iterator class provides an iterator for the Collection class. 
The Collection class is a simple class that stores a list of items, and the Iterator class provides a way to 
iterate over the items in the collection.

The Iterator class has a reference to the collection and an internal index that keeps track of the 
current position in the collection. The Iterator class implements the __iter__ and __next__ methods, 
which are used by the for-in loop to iterate over the collection. The __iter__ method returns the iterator object, 
and the __next__ method returns the next item in the collection.

The Iterator pattern is useful when you need to iterate over a collection of objects but don't want to 
expose the underlying implementation of the collection. This pattern also allows to change the underlying collection 
without affecting the client code. Also, it is useful to support multiple traversals of the collection.

It is a simple and effective way to traverse a collection of objects, abstracting the details of the 
collection's implementation and providing a consistent interface for traversing the collection.
"""


# ============================== State Design Patterns ==============================
"""
The State pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change its behavior based on 
its internal state. The pattern allows an object to have different behavior depending on its internal state, 
without having to change its class.

Use Cases:
1. The UI state of a video player, like play, pause, stop, forward, backward etc.
2. The state of a vending machine, like idle, waiting for coin, waiting for selection, dispensing item, dispensing change, etc.
3. The state of an order, like received, processing, shipped, delivered, etc.
4. The state of a connection, like disconnected, connecting, connected, etc.
5. The state of a document editor, like read-only, editable, locked, etc.
6. The state of a traffic light, like red, yellow, green etc.

context = Context()
context.set_state(StateA())
context.handle()  # Handling in State A
context.set_state(StateB())
context.handle()  # Handling in State B

"""
In this example, the State class is an interface for different states, the StateA and StateB classes are 
concrete implementations of the State interface and they define the behavior of the Context class in different states.

The Context class has a reference to the current state and it uses the state's handle method to perform the operation. 
The handle method of the Context class calls the handle method of the current state object, which changes the behavior of the 
Context class based on the current state.

The State pattern is useful when an object's behavior changes based on its internal state, 
and when you need to encapsulate the behavior of the object in different states. It makes it easy to add new 
states and change the behavior of an object without changing its class, and it promotes low coupling and high cohesion.

It is a powerful way to implement state-dependent behavior without having to use large switch statements or 
if-else chains, and it allows to separate the code for each state, making it more readable and maintainable.
"""


# ============================== Visitor Design Patterns ==============================
"""
The Visitor pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to add new behavior to a set of classes without 
changing their source code. The pattern allows you to define a new operation without changing the classes of the 
elements on which it operates.

Use Cases:
1. The evaluation of a mathematical expression tree, where the operation (evaluation) is separate from the object structure (the tree).
2. The printing of a document, where the operation (printing) is separate from the object structure (the document).
3. The calculation of the total area of a geometric shape, where the operation (calculation) is separate from the object structure (the shape).

"""
In this example, the Element class is an interface for different elements, the ConcreteElementA

the behavior of the Visitor class.

The Visitor class defines a set of methods called visit, one for each type of element. 
The ConcreteVisitor1 and ConcreteVisitor2 classes are concrete implementations of the Visitor interface, 
and they define the behavior of the Element classes in different ways.

The accept method of the Element class calls the corresponding visit method of the Visitor class. 
The accept method of the Element class takes a Visitor object as an argument and calls the visit method of the 
Visitor class, passing the Element object as an argument.

The Visitor pattern is useful when you need to add new behavior to a set of classes without
