* Gradient descent: 
    A widely used optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the parameters of a model by taking small steps in the
    direction of the negative gradient of the objective function.

* Genetic algorithms:
    An evolutionary algorithm that mimics the process of natural selection to search for optimal solutions to a problem.

* Particle swarm optimization:
    An optimization technique that simulates the behavior of a swarm of particles moving in a search space to find the global minimum of an objective function.

* Simulated annealing:
    An optimization algorithm that uses a stochastic process inspired by the physical process of annealing to search for optimal solutions.

* Ant colony optimization:
    An optimization technique that simulates the behavior of ant colonies to search for optimal solutions.

* Tabu search:
    A metaheuristic optimization algorithm that uses a memory-based search to avoid revisiting previously explored solutions.

* Bayesian optimization:
    An optimization algorithm that uses a probabilistic model to balance exploration and exploitation in the search space.

* Differential evolution:
  An evolutionary algorithm that optimizes a population of candidate solutions by generating new solutions using a difference operator.

* Hill climbing:
    An iterative optimization algorithm that moves towards the optimal solution by making small incremental changes to the current solution.
