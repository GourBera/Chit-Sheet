Functions are first-class citizens in Python
Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
Functions can be returned as values from other functions
Functions can be assigned to variables and stored in data structures


def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

addition = [add_numbers]
print(addition[0])
print(addition[0](10, 20))    #30
